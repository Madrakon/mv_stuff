Hi, I'm MatouÅ¡ VÄ›trovec and I'm a young programmer and developer.
I started compiling this script when I was developing the FiveM 
server and I 
had to always give everything that this script contains one by one and here you have it,
it's all free and the best thing is that it's not leaked and trigger safe
